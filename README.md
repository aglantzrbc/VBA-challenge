# VBA-challenge - module 2 (Excel VBA macros) - Adam Glantz 20230423pm

The challenge assignment solution is my own work. I haven't see the code for any other attempts at a solution to this challenge besides mine.

I used code from Rutgers Boot Camps LLC Data Science assignments and presentations (RUT-VIRT-DATA-PT-04-2023-U-LOLC), particularly the 06-Stu_CreditCardChecker-CellComparison assignment (https://git.bootcampcontent.com/Rutgers-University/RUT-VIRT-DATA-PT-04-2023-U-LOLC/-/tree/main/02-VBA-Scripting/3/Activities/06-Stu_CreditCardChecker-CellComparison) available on Rutgers' GitLab space. I usually modified the code for my own circumstances.

I looked up some built-in functions, most notably the Application.WorksheetFunction.Max() function that allows you to find a maximum value in a range of values, from Stack Overflow entries (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51909500/only-save-the-code).

I am available to discuss this at any time: adamglantz@yahoo.com and (in the US) 571-232-9753;
